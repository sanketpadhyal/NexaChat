## ✨ Introduction  

Welcome to **NexaChat** 📌, a clean and simple **chat app** where you can:  
- Join **multiple chat rooms**  
- Use **temporary usernames**  
- Chat with **no permanent data storage**  
- Enjoy **real-time conversations** with **full privacy**  

This project is the **evolution of my earlier Soulmate project**, scaled up into a fully functioning chat platform with **authentication, admin tools, and temporary storage**.

## 🚀 Our Story  

The idea came from my project [Soulmate](https://github.com/SanketPadhyal/soulbuddy), which inspired me to create something **more robust, anonymous, and privacy-first**.  

I spent **countless hours (sometimes overnight 🌙)** learning **WebSockets, Firebase, and backend scaling**.  
NexaChat is not just an app — it’s a **reflection of passion, persistence, and continuous learning**.
