## Introduction

Welcome to **NexaChat** üìå, a secure, anonymous, and real-time chat platform designed with introverts and privacy-conscious users in mind. Created by Sanket Padhyal, NexaChat is my dream project and the largest development of mine till now.

NexaChat offers a clean, simple interface where users can join multiple chat rooms, customize their usernames temporarily, and enjoy instant messaging without permanent data storage ‚Äî all backed by modern web technologies for reliability and speed.

## Our Story

The journey of NexaChat began from my earlier project [Soulmate](https://github.com/SanketPadhyal/soulbuddy), Motivated me to create a more robust and anonymous chat experience, I poured countless hours ‚Äî sometimes overnight ‚Äî learning and implementing frontend and backend systems.

Despite many challenges, the project evolved into a functional, scalable chat application leveraging Firebase authentication, Node.js with WebSockets, and a sleek frontend interface. NexaChat reflects my commitment to privacy, user experience, and cutting-edge web development.
